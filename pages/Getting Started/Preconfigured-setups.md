Don't want to spend days tinkering with Hyprland to get it just right from scratch, but you'd
rather start from a DE-like setting? You've found the right place.

Here are a few options to consider:

## ML4W

ML4W or My Linux 4 Work, is a great DE-like experience out-of-the-box made by Stephan Raabe.

It includes simple gui settings apps, pre-configured feature-rich panels, a welcome app, and more.

## JaKooLit

Would you rather like something a bit more similar, yet still very easy to install?

JaKooLit provides installation scripts for many distros for their dotfiles, with
many themes to choose from.

Prefer something more minimal, clean and aesthetic? Are you a terminal enjoyer?
Prasanthrangan's dotfiles are a very popular choice that will suit your needs.
